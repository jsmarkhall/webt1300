            <h3>1. Architects</h3>

            <p>At the top of the list I'd like to introduce Architects.
                Architects are a british group that recently released
                "For Those That Wish to Exist," an almost hour-long album
                that explores a sound that does more than build off of the
                foundation of previous works. Prior to this album they had a much more
                defined sound that people came to know them for. Filled with ambient guitars,
                heavy riffs, and complex rhythm over all, Architects used a formula
                up until this new album. So in terms of the main album that is considered a true, metalcore masterpiece,
                their 2016 work "All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us" really drives the genre home with it's incredible
                songwriting
                and guitar work by the late Tom Searle, who wrote what most consider to be their best works. It's
                considered that
                this album moved the entire genre in a new direction, making it one of the most important albums of the
                genre.

            <h4>2. Bring Me the Horizon</h4>

            <p>
                Second on the list is another british group known as Bring Me the Horizon. Sempiternal, released in
                2013, serves
                as a landmark in the genre as songs like "Can You Feel My Heart," "Shadow Moses" and "Sleepwalking"
                made it into the world of mainstream music bringing more attention to the genre. Oddly enough, over
                time, Bring Me
                the Horizon would take a different direction with their music that was more pop-based that was heavily
                present in amo (2019), and then throwing a curveball
                with their most recent EP, Post Human: Survival Horror which was more metalcore based and even contained
                a song featuring mainstream artist YUNGBLUD.
                This is important because it just shows that Bring me the Horizon has the ability to do more than what
                they became known for, and that's why they are on this list.
                They are very talented and their contributions to the mental health community through releases such as
                Sempiternal, which had very emotional songwriting that was considered
                highly relatable have to be recognized.

            <h5>3. The Amity Affliction</h5>

            <p>
                Finally, I feel like the Amity Affliction deserves some recognition on this list. They have a
                discography that is hard to argue with,
                filled with heavy instrumentals and powerful vocals/lyrics that some would say make metalcore metalcore.
                An album such as Let the Ocean Take Me (2014) is such an iconic album
                as it featured hit songs such as "Pittsburgh" and "Don't Lean on Me" but carried the same overall
                theme/sound throughout the whole album. The Amity Affliction is known for having
                lyrical content that is relatable with the mental health community, and that's a very important aspect
                not just for metalcore, but modern music as a whole. Let the Ocean Take Me has all
                of that and more, and they've continued to create music that has just that making them one of my top
                reccomendations for people who are interested in the genre.
