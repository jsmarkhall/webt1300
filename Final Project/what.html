        <h2>What Do I Do?</h2>
        <p>Today I make music, design artwork for musical works, occasionally play video games and generally I just like to do a lot of "nerdy stuff."</p>

        <h2>Creating Music</h2>
        <p>For my music creation I use the DAW FL Studio 20. There's different hardware and instruments I use as well such as a a Fender Squier Jazzmaster, an LTD EC-256 with some seymour duncan pickups installed, and I record those with a Focusrite Scarlett Solo 3rd Generation bridged by a connection through a BOSS GT-6 Guitar Effects Processor. There's also the one thing that makes it all happen: My computer. Built with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700K CPU @ 3.70GHz, Nvidia Geforce GTX 1060 6GB it gets the job done for sure.</p>

        <h2>Creating Art</h2>
        <p>For this section I'll mainly let the art speak for itself. These are from various different albums I've worked on. I use GIMP for image manipulation and sources for these images can come from a variety of different areas. Sometimes they're just based on photographs, sometimes it's all in the program itself. Or sometimes there's other weird sources.</p>

        <h2>Video Games?</h2>
        <p>
            I do enjoy playing some video games from time to time. As of 9/30/21 I am waiting for the arrival of Halo: Infinite, Alan Wake Remastered and what the future holds for Cyberpunk 2077.
        </p>
        <h2>What Makes Wahoo Nerdy?</h2>
        <p>Well as you saw by my computer setup I love color coordination with everything. I configure allpapers within a program called Wallpaper Engine to match all of my RGB lighting. I love to do ReShading for video games, I enjoy working with synthesizers as a music producer and really I love the world of electronics. Sometimes I'll spend hours just learning how to do something random on a computer. For example, I've given my Amazon Echo the ability to open Playnite, a universal game launcher that I've fully configured to make my own. Within that I can launch a portable version of Kodi running off of an external hard drive, and pretty much everything is controlled with my gamepad for the closest thing to a console experience without actually using a console. (This is an older video, so this isn't the full representation.)</p>
